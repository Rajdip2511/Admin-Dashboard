# Employee Creation Fix Summary

## Issue
The employee creation feature wasn't working - new employees couldn't be added through the dashboard.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a **JWT token structure mismatch**:

- The authorization middleware (`backend-parlour-api/src/middleware/auth.ts`) was expecting the JWT token to have a nested structure: `{ user: { id, email, role } }`
- But the auth controller was generating tokens with a flat structure: `{ id, email, role }`

This caused the authorization middleware to fail when checking user roles, resulting in "Access denied. You do not have the required role." errors.

## Solution
Updated the JWT token generation in `backend-parlour-api/src/controllers/authController.ts`:

**Before:**
```javascript
const token = jwt.sign(
  { 
    id: testUser.id, 
    email: testUser.email, 
    role: testUser.role 
  },
  JWT_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: '24h' }
);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const token = jwt.sign(
  { 
    user: {
      id: testUser.id, 
      email: testUser.email, 
      role: testUser.role 
    }
  },
  JWT_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: '24h' }
);
```

## Additional Fixes
1. **Frontend TypeScript Issues**: Updated the `EmployeeForm` component to properly handle both creating new employees (with password) and updating existing employees (without password) using proper type definitions.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added better error handling and logging in the `EmployeeForm` component to help with debugging.

## Test Results
After the fix, the employee creation works perfectly:
- ✅ Super Admin can create new employees
- ✅ New employees are added to the mock data system
- ✅ Employee list refreshes automatically after creation
- ✅ All form validation works correctly

## How to Test
1. Login with Super Admin credentials: `superadmin@parlour.com` / `password123`
2. Go to Employee Management page
3. Click "Add Employee" button
4. Fill out the form with all required fields including password
5. Submit the form
6. New employee should appear in the list immediately

The employee creation feature is now **fully functional** for local development and testing!
